        <p class="intro__text">
          According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
          but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country. Like,
          why are we here at home, haven't you seen it? In fact, Russia is a
          whole universe with affectionate the sea of the south, the dense
          forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana
          plateau. And also you can see all these beauties without millions on
          your account, a passport and hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera
          Bashmakova — a brave young mom, who took three children in her arms,
          sat them in her Lada and I drove 20 thousand kilometers across my
          native country. We have selected and described some interesting places
          worthy of your vacation.

              of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates
              the hustle and bustle, plunging into the tranquility of nature and
              the smell of the steel, cool sea.

              remain under the snow of school memories of geography lessons.
              Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating
              the earth's crust, and apathy has been covering you for a long
              time. But your dream of seeing the Northern lights begins to come

              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all,
              because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will
              see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And
              if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with
              the invisible miracle of these places — mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in
              summer. So you will see all the diversity of the local flora and
              fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the
              ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls
              are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

              Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also
              they know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one
              of the the most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Of course, this is all true. Baikal is still an ideal place for
              skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier he
              ties himself to a motorcycle, and tries to develop the tandem as
              much as possible high speed on the ice. In March 2019 at the
              festival "Baikal Mile" was set a world record — 197.011 km/h.

              here it reaches 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks
              have never known an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines
              are already more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being
              who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin
              forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on
              rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked
              with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.
